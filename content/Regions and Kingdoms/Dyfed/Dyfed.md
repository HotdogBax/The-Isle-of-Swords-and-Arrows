**Geographical features**
The geography of the Kingdom of Dyfed is very similar to the geography of England if you were to smash it together with the southern alps of New Zealand. The only Difference to them is that Dyfed has a connection through some very rough mountain terrain that connects them to the continent of Brihaenihog in the south.

# Neighbouring Kingdoms

### The Utwah

A collection of warbands of [[Giants]], Trolls, and Goblins living in the mountains to the south of Dyfed. Sometimes these warbands come down from the mountains to raid Dyfed towns.

There are some in Dyfed that are distant descendants of some of the [[Utwah Mountains]], but they would not call the people of the mountains their relatives. For example those with red hair often will have a relation to a Fire Giant in their past.

### Brinwaer

A nearby country to Dyfed. Around 50 years ago their king died suddenly and with no clear living heirs a noble from the Cherian Empire appeared with a claim to the throne and an army to back him up. Over the past 50 years there have been mass expulsions of Tieflings, Dragonborn and other semi monstrous races into Dyfed while the Empire has been forcing their religion onto its people.

A number of people from Brinwaer left for the mountains and it is said that there are organised groups of bandits made up of these expelled Brinwaers and they hate the Cherian more than anyone.

### The Empire of Cherian

A roman empire style collection of states that are ruled by a holy prophet. The people of this empire are mostly human, and anyone with power is directly connected to the prophet. The empire is always trying to reach out its tendrils to Dyfed which is the last big kingdom on the continent that is not under their control.

The Empire wants Dyfed because they call the magics, Fae, and non Humans as works of [[Ika’e Maiata]] (essentially the devil) Because of this the people of Dyfed are highly suspicious and antagonistic towards anyone that is connected to the empire.

The religion that the empire forces upon its citizens is called the Children of Lanodice (Lanodice being the name given to each successive holy prophet that leads the religion)

The tenants of the Children of Lanodice are ones of servitude and subservience. With each member being somewhere in the hierarchy and having a direct superior that they follow. With the chain going all the way up to Holy Emperor Lanodice who’s superior is God. Therefore no member of the church other than Lanodice prays to their God and this is a part of the religion that the cleric of the church find difficult preaching to new followers.

## The people of Dyfed and the Fae

Within the Kingdom of Dyfed there is a significant crossover with the world of the Fae. This is most evident in cities like Fendelwin Castle and city. The Area used to be an enormous forest brimming with Dryads, [[Pexies]], [[Bodach]], [[Ghillie Dhu]] and others. But the story goes that the first king of Dyfed (for which the castle is named) made a deal with the lady of the lake for an area which “could be a sanctuary for both Man and Fae from invaders.”

So, today within the city there are still a number of Fae. However, the primary inhabitants are Humans, Dwarves, Half-Elves, Gnomes and other humanoids. The forest on the east bank of the river is teeming with all creatures of magical descent.
