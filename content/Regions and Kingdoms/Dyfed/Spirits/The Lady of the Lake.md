### The lady of the lake

Most myths and legends about the surrounding area from folklore start or finish with the lady of the lake. It is well known that she lives in the glowing green waters of the Emerald Lake, and that she will give a boon for a curse to any traveller that seeks her out.

The greater the boon the greater the curse. Some curses have been known to persist beyond death and have been passed onto heirs and whole family lines.
