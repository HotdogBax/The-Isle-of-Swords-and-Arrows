**Bodach**

His name means “the old man” or “the poor farmer”, and it may be that he was father in some manner to the banshees, for his appearance usually foretells death and disaster. Dressed in poor and rustic clothes, maybe chewing a straw with an old hat perched low on his head, the old man looks on with a dark and knowing eye filled with laughter at the doings of mortals, soon to pass.

The Bodach loves to play tricks on people, and especially on children, tricks of a sort that don't usually end well. He comes down chimneys in the form of a shadow and slips through open windows or even thin cracks too narrow for so much as a mouse to get through, poking and irritating people, keeping them awake, but it is said he will not cross salt spread in a hearth or across a threshold.
