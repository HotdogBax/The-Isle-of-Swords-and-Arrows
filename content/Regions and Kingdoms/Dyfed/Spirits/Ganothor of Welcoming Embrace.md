**Description** 
A mass of leaves that vaguely resembles a person. His calm green eyes made of the dew from a fresh morning frost recently melted on a green leaf.

**Domain** 
The land that the city was built on was once a forest for which Ganothor was the spirit of. His personality was, like his grove, very peaceful, relaxed and welcoming.

**History** 
When Man first came to Fendelwin Ganothor welcomed them with an open embrace. But that embrace has not been returned in some time. The last remaining part of his grove is the secluded garden within the castle walls, and the giant oak that is moored at the breaking of the river.
