**History:**
Zion's origin is rooted in the clash of titanic forces during the creation of the world. Born from the fusion of primal lightning and the roar of thunder, he emerged as a guardian of the celestial balance. Legends speak of him intervening in battles between other elemental spirits, using his storms to restore harmony and order. Over time, he became a symbol of the raw power of nature and a force to be respected by those who navigate the unpredictable realms of weather. Worshipers seek his favour for protection during storms and attribute the regenerative power of rain to his benevolence.
