### Pexies

Within the bounds of Fendelwin City there are many perfect circles of flowers which roads have had to be paved around. These circles are the dwellings of mildly powerful Fae called Pexies. These Spirits are known for finding joy in chaos and enjoy tricking people who seem too uptight.

A number of Pexies though have left these dwellings and now roam the streets as citizens of the City. These Pexies do not derive the same amount of joy that the others do from pranks, they instead have become extraordinarily involved in merchantry. The Pexie merchants are well known for their bargaining and their cut throat tactics when it comes down to it.
