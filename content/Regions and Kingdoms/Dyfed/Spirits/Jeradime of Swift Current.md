 **History** 
 Before man came to Fendelwin she was in a constant tug of war with Ganothor for his grove because it divided her river in two and in those days the two spirits would playfully engage in this jovial conflict. But in the day of Fendelwin Castle and City, the Spirit does not get to engage Ganothor in conflict for fear it would end her dearest friend as their power is now so uneven. So her persistent swift current is calmed until the day that her friend is strong enough to endure her torrent.
