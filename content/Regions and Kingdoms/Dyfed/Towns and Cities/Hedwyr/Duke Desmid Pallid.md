### Duke Desmid Pallid

Duke of Hedwyr Duchy, the border duchy, Desmid Pallid is an aristocrat in every possible way. He is known by his people as a wise, crafty and strategic man who works to better the duchy through hiring mercenary bands to often pass though towns closest to the Utwah mountains so they might help should the need arise. People within his Duchy often feel that the opulent wealth that he lives in is not conducive of a duke that values his people first.

**Description**

A tall blonde man with lanky features that clearly don't lend him to physical labour. His clothes are often coloured blue with expensive foreign dyes. His distinguishing feature is his glasses which are wide and thick, implying his sight is not well to do.

**Family**

The eldest of three siblings to the late Duchess Kelerina who very nearly ran the south into the ground with her opulence. The younger siblings of the Duke are both knights in the Kingâ€™s employ and roam with their highly trained squads along the border ready to defend from raids.
