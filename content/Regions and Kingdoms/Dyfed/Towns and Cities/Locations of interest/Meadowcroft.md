### Meadowcroft

A charming Gnomish village nestled in a serene meadow. Quaint gnome-sized homes surrounded by vibrant gardens and a bustling marketplace. Known for its industrious and nature-loving inhabitants, fostering a warm and welcoming community spirit.

The town used to be entirely run by a gang of bandits called the Crimson Hand, but around 3 years ago a lone man in a pointy hat slaughtered the lot of them.
