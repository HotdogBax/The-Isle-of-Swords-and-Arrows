### Silverbrook

A bustling trading town where humans, dwarves, and halflings converge, known for its silver mines and skilled craftsmen. The town's impressive forges produce exquisite silverware, attracting merchants from far and wide to trade in its vibrant market square.

Silverbrook also hosts a small number of Cherian nobles who wish to own the worked silver. Some of these nobles then move on to collect a boon from the Lady of the Lake, which is not far.
