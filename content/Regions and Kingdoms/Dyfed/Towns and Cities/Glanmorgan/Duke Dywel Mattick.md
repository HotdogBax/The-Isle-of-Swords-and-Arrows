### **Duke Dywel Mattick**

Duke of Glanmorgan the seaside Duchy, he rules there without any direct involvement in the day to day of his duchy. Known well for his great experience in defence from pirate raids and training behind the wheel of a ship. He came to the role of Duke by accident from an abdication  from his elder brother who fell ill. He is seen as more of an eccentric but fair duke being the kind of guy that you can have a mead with as opposed to sort out your legal disputes.

**Description**

Short gruff dark skinned man with a long curly beard. He looks to be not much older than 30 but his age is not publicly known. His visage is more of a sailor than a ruler with his hands being tough with callouses. His distinguishing factor however is the eye patch that covers a wound he took in the defence of a merchant vessel from a pirate attack in his youth.

**Family**

Still has his elder brother who abdicated but he is stuck from sickness in his bed. Son of the late Duke Yipsor Mattick who was very much well liked in his duchy.
