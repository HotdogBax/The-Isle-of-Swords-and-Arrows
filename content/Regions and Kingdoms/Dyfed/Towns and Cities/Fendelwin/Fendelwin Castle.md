### Construction

- During the reign of Fendelwin Vespit, the construction of Fendelwin Castle began as a strategic endeavor to secure control over the Swale River Crossing. Overseeing the project personally, Fendelwin Vespit employed skilled local craftsmen and artisans, utilizing the abundant sandstone from the nearby deposit to erect the castle's formidable walls and towers. The castle's design, a feat of engineering, capitalized on the natural advantage of the hill dividing the river, ensuring both defensive prowess and an imposing symbol of authority that stood visible for miles around, signifying Fendelwin Vespit's dominance over the landscape.

### Hilltop Castle

- Fendelwin Castle is positioned atop a prominent hill that divides the Swale River. It overlooks the river crossing, affording a strategic vantage point for monitoring and controlling traffic along the river.

### River Division

- The castle hill divides the Swale River into two branches, creating a natural barrier that necessitates crossing through the castle's domain for river traversal. The ruling authority controls these crossings, enabling toll collection and regulation of trade and travel.

### Mills and Fishing

- Water-powered mills are established along both branches of the Swale River, harnessing its flow for milling and grinding grains. Fishing boats and docks are present on both sides, providing sustenance and trade opportunities.

### Castle's Dominance

- Fendelwin Castle's elevated position ensures visibility from both sides of the river, symbolizing power and control over the land and riverways. Its presence serves as a reminder of authority and protection for the townsfolk.

### Natural Resources

- The nearby sandstone deposit remains to the west of the castle, offering valuable resources for construction and trade, contributing to the town's economy.

### Castle Fortifications

- The castle employs concentric rings of defence, strategically positioned on the hill to maximize protection for the ruling authorities and the town.

### Flat Surroundings and Farmland

- The flat lands surrounding the castle and town are transformed into fertile farmland, benefiting from the river's presence and ensuring agricultural prosperity.
