### Ulysses the story teller

The old scribe of Castle Fendelwin. He is well into his 70s. Known well in Fendelwin for the man who introduced the rule that any man woman or child has the right to learn how to read and write should they come to the castle. These days Ulysses spends most of his waking hours sitting infront of the great hearth in the great hall telling stories he has memorised to gathered children.

**Description**

Hunched over with long grey hair, his eyes clouded over and hands bulbous from arthiritis. His warm smile and gentle voice avoids any misinterpretaion that this man is good. His skin is greying with age but is still pale from his years spent inside reading and writing.

**Family**

Ulysses does not have any family by blood but those who have grown up in the castle will view him as a kindly grandfather and he considers them his surrogate grandchildren.
