## Fendelwin Duchy

This is the richest Duchy of the Kingdom because of its control of the river which goes from the sea side all the way to the Utwah mountains. They also monitor and tax all interactions of trade between non-Fae and Fae within legal bounds.

**Fendelwin Castle**

The castle that sits at the center of the duchy, built of and on the land given to the first king of dyfed by the lady of the lake. The castle is built from primarily sandstone which has been quarried from the nearby hills.

The castle sits on a mini island in the center of the river flow overlooking the manmade river crossing which is wide enough to transport large siege equipment across.

The castle is in 3 concentric rings that rise in height each ring. In the center ring is the kings tower and banquet hall. The guards quarters are in the outermost ring and near the main gate.

It has been theorized that a group of less than 100 men could repel an entire army using the castle as a fortification.

**Fendelwin City**

The sprawling town that extends from either side of the river is immense and populated with all manner of peoples.
