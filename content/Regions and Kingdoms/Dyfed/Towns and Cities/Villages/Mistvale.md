### Mistvale

Nestled in a valley shrouded by perpetual mist, this mysterious town is home to a diverse mix of elves, tieflings, and gnomes. Renowned for its magical trinkets, Mistvale serves as a sanctuary for scholars studying ancient mysteries and lost artifacts, hidden from the world beyond the misty veil.

The old town Witch was called Samantha the wise, but no one has seen her in years.
