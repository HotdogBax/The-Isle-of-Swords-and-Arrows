Giants are known for their size which depending on their age can be anywhere from 7-8ft tall to even 50-60ft tall. pure-blooded Giants grow taller with age. They primarily live in the [[Utwah Mountains]]

There are four primary sub-races of giants,

- **Stone**
    - with greyed skin these giants are heartier than most
- **Frost**
    - these have more pale skin and tend to have lighter hair. They sometimes have abilityes to regulate temperature around them
- **Storm**
    - these darker skinned giants have eyes that crackle like lightning and often have strength to rival that of the wind.
- **Fire**
    - these giants are often born light skin with red hair and lighter eyes. their hands often tinted black from the flames that coat their weapons in battle.

Most Giants are able to track their lineage back to several of these subraces and so the powers that they provide are usually watered down significantly. However if you meet a mostly pure-blooded Giant of one race or another you will recognise it from their distinctive magic.
