**The mountains of the giants**

[[Giants]] are known well for their size, ferocity and tendency to raid others for food rather than grow their own. However their most notable difference in society to that of [[Dyfed]] is their personality. The Giant kingdom or the Utwah is split into 4 clans each with their own leadership structures and customs. The primary [[Customs]] that span all the clans is the idea of unspoken laws that can only be learned of through stories and not expressly stated as laws. Travellers to the Utwah have often found out the effect of transgressing these laws the hard way.

**The giants and magic.**

There has always been a connection between the giants and magic. There has often been a scald to the chieftains of the clans to provide in an advisory capacity but the source of their magic is not discussed. They are seen to be throwing bones to determine the future.

### The 4 Primary Clans

**Iron clan**

regarded as the most industrious clan of the Utwah mountains they have direct connections to the underdark with which they gather recourses through trade and not entirely from raids. Their [[Chieftain Unalak]] will make deals for the best of the clan and sometimes is seen to be pulling away from strictly Giantish society.

The Iron clan has a stronghold high in the Utwah mountains called [[Highkeep]] that nestled between two mountain peaks so as to be protected from weather. The stronghold is said to be one of the largest castles to have ever been built.

The path to reach their stronghold is treacherous hence why they rarely leave it.

**White hand clan**

A clan that is known in the mountains as the most violent, patriarchal and quick to action. Their name comes from the white hand print that is applied to each of their warriors foreheads prior to battle. The white comes from the ash of their forefathers who died outside of battle. The Chieftain of this clan is Ganothorn an _Old_ giant that has been rumoured to have lived for longer than 300 years. During that time has created a lineage of hardened warriors that will follow his every command.

**Bone breaker clan**

The bone breaker clan has the least to do with other Giants and the most to do with the people living to the south of Dyfed. Their warrior bands often come down to prey on towns and their recourses. They have not a chief but instead a warrior council that works nearly democratically (if democracy was based on physical strength of ascent as opposed to majority rules)

**Cripsor Clan**

Not much is known of the Cripsor clan, they are isolationist even for giants. Their people do not raid other giants, nor do they take part in the raids on Dyfed.
