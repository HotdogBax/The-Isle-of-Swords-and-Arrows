One of the largest castles to have ever existed in all of [[Brihaenihog]]

Highkeep is an imposing fortress and the seat of power for the Iron Clan, a prominent Utwah clan known for its expertise in trade with the mysterious inhabitants of the Underdark. The keep is situated atop a craggy mountain peak, offering strategic advantages. Constructed entirely from massive stone blocks, Highkeep embodies the strength and resilience of the Iron Clan.

The keep’s walls are made of thick, reinforced stone, designed to withstand both physical assaults and the harsh elements. The exterior is adorned with intricate carvings depicting the clan’s history and legendary battles.

Highkeep features towering spires and battlements that provide excellent vantage points for surveillance and defence. The highest tower, known as the Sky watch, serves as an observatory and a symbol of the clan's dominance.

Beneath the keep lies an extensive network of tunnels and chambers, providing secure storage for goods and access to deep mines. These tunnels also serve as trade routes to the Underdark, facilitating commerce with its denizens.

Along one of these such trade routes is the [[Library of the Wizened Stone]]

Highkeep houses numerous forges and workshops where the clan’s skilled blacksmiths and artisans produce high-quality weapons, tools, and armour. These goods are highly sought after in trade.

**Key Locations**:

- **The Grand Hall**: A vast chamber where the Iron Clan’s leaders gather to discuss matters of governance and trade. The hall is adorned with banners, trophies from past victories, and a massive stone throne.
- **The Trade Bazaar**: An expansive marketplace within the keep where Utwah merchants and traders from the Underdark exchange goods. Stalls and shops offer a wide variety of items, from precious metals to exotic spices.
- **The Forge Quarter**: A district fully dedicated to the clan’s blacksmiths and craftsmen. Where the sound of hammers on anvils and the glow of molten metal are constant, as artisans create the renowned Iron Clan products.
- **The Catacombs**: Beneath Highkeep lies a labyrinthine network of tunnels known as the Catacombs. These passages connect to deep mines and provide secure routes for trade with the Underdark. They are also used for storage and as a refuge during sieges.
