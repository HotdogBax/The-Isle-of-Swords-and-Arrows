regarded as the most industrious clan of the Utwah mountains they have direct connections to the underdark with which they gather recourses through trade and not entirely from raids. Their [[Chieftain Unalak]] will make deals for the best of the clan and sometimes is seen to be pulling away from strictly Giantish society.

The Iron clan has a stronghold called [[Highkeep]] high in the Utwah mountains that nestled between two mountain peaks so as to be protected from weather. The stronghold is said to be one of the largest castles to have ever been built.

The path to reach their stronghold is treacherous hence why they rarely leave it.
