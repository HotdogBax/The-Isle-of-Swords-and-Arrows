**Location and Environment**: Hotrock is an extraordinary town perched near the summit of a towering, active volcano. This unique location offers breath-taking views of the surrounding mountain ranges and valleys. The town is nestled on a series of terraced plateaus carved into the volcanic rock, providing stability and protection against potential eruptions and lava flows.

**Architecture and Infrastructure**:

- Buildings in Hotrock are constructed primarily from the abundant volcanic stone, with some structures incorporating cooled magma for added strength and resilience. The architecture features thick walls and robust foundations to withstand the occasional tremors.
- The Utwah harness the geothermal energy of the volcano. Natural hot springs are used for communal baths, cooking, and heating. Steam vents are channelled into homes and workshops, providing a constant source of heat and power.
- The town is built on a series of terraces that step down the volcanic slope. Each terrace is connected by wide, stone stairways and ramps, designed to accommodate the Utwah's large size and facilitate the transport of goods and resources.
