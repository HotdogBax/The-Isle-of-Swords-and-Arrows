### Governance and Leadership

**Leadership and Hierarchy**:

- Leadership is determined through a bi-decade event called the Trial of Strength, where the strongest Utwah compete in various challenges. The victor becomes the Grand Chieftain, governing for ten years. This changes slightly between clans but remains the same for the vast majority of them.
- The Council of Elders, composed of the five oldest and wisest Utwah, assists the Grand Chieftain. They preserve oral histories, oversee rituals, and mediate disputes.

### Social Conduct and Responsibilities

**Communal Life**:

- Communal feasts and festivals are central to Utwah society, with everyone contributing food and resources.
    - examples of events are Winterfest (held in Highkeep at middle day of winter), Trial of strength, The Great Hunt, and The Festival of Ancestors (which happens on the shortest day of the year)

**Personal Honour and Disputes**:

- Disputes are often resolved through honour duels, which are overseen by an Elder to ensure fairness and prevent serious injury. If unresolved, the Council of Elders mediates the conflict.

### Property and Resources

**Land and Resource Management**:

- Land and resources such as timber, stone, and game are communal. The Grand Chieftain and council allocate land for personal use based on community needs.
- Utwah take great pride in their crafted tools and weapons, which must meet quality standards maintained by the Craftsmaster. Trade with other clans is heavily regulated to ensure resource balance.

### Spiritual and Ceremonial Practices

**Worship and Rituals**:

- Utwah honour ancestors and natural elements through seasonal rituals conducted by the High Shaman. These practices are integral to their spiritual life.
- **Desecration and Respect**: Disrespecting sacred sites or ancestors is a grave offense, leading to severe penalties such as exile or servitude.

**Rites of Passage**:

- Young Utwah undergo a Rite of Maturity, involving trials that test their strength, wisdom, and courage. This marks their transition into adulthood.
- Utwah observe strict funerary practices, constructing monumental cairns or pyres to honour the deceased, accompanied by mourning rituals and celebrations of life.

### Conflict and Warfare

**Defence and Strategy**:

- The War Council, led by the Grand Chieftain, strategizes all military actions. Utwah are trained in siege warfare and use of massive weapons, with mandatory participation in defence efforts.

### Environmental Stewardship

**Sustainable Living**:

- Utwah practice sustainable living, taking only what they need and ensuring the land remains fertile. The Earthkeeper oversees these practices and enforces environmental regulations. This is required because of the harsh environment they live in.

### Cultural Expressions

**Storytelling and Music**:

- Utwah have a rich tradition of storytelling, recounting epic tales of heroes, battles, and adventures around communal fires. This is essential to the passing down of their customs.
- Music played on large drums and deep-toned instruments, along with robust, rhythmic dances, are central to their celebrations and rituals.
