### Description

- flowing colourful robe with a sachel that contains notebooks, writing and drawing utensils.

### Personality

### History

- born in the city of Fendlewin (the main one)
- trained to be a leatherworker like his father.
- decided to leave the leatherworking buisness to become a artist.
- spent 5 years painting, writing, proclaiming his art to all that would hear and see it.
- until he was accepted into the college of Barlum (the most prestigious arts college in all the 7 lands)
- studied there for 6 years and was a star student and artist from the get go.
- after leaving the college he joined the playwriting society and wrote plays exclusively for the King’s theatre (the one that bruno and theo visited)
- from there he has been travling on his quest to save a fair maiden from the clutches of an evil (sultry) invisible dragon in a tower on the west coast.
- unfortunately he took several wrong turns and has ended up in Calmaria’s Travlers Den performing to crowds of adoring fans.
