**Witch of the Woodland Green**

Willow is a kindly _old_ witch she has been the witch of the woodland green for longer than most memories go back.

She stands taller than 7ft with long spindly drooping limbs. Her hair mainly moss that reaches down to her ankles.

She is known to be very wise. She is slow to action, and patient as a tree.

her goals seem to revolve around maintaining what parts of the world are green as such not encroaching on others but not giving up what she has.

- [[Ambrose]] has met Willow several times accompanying his master [[Rowena]] she was very kind to him offering advice to questions he wished the answer of. (I will allow you to call back a flashback to this if you have a question you would wish to ask her mid game)
