***Current Witches*

**Witch of the Waning moon

Samantha has recently ascended to the position of Witch of the Waning moon.

As Arianrhod Apprentice she was a kind, soft spoken, and had extraordinary empathy towards all she helped.

- Ambrose has not met her before but has met Arianrhod early in his training.

**Witch of the Wild Hunt**

Hecate has been the witch of the wild hunt for over 100 years.

at this point she is more beast than Witch. She holds that her domain encroaches directly on that of people of the world. She is constantly pushing for more wilderness.

She is one to be met on equal terms and is known to have been behind many disappearances within deep woods.

- Ambrose has not met Hecate, Rowena said it was best to avoid Hecate.

**Witch of the Woodland Green**

Willow is a kindly _old_ witch she has been the witch of the woodland green for longer than most memories go back.

She stands taller than 7ft with long spindly drooping limbs. Her hair mainly moss that reaches down to her ankles.

She is known to be very wise. She is slow to action, and patient as a tree.

her goals seem to revolve around maintaining what parts of the world are green as such not encroaching on others but not giving up what she has.

- Ambrose has met Willow several times accompanying his master Rowena she was very kind to him offering advice to questions he wished the answer of. (I will allow you to call back a flashback to this if you have a question you would wish to ask her mid game)

**Witch of the Watching fire**

Gabija has been Witch of the Watching Fire for the past 27 years.

Often seen wearing full plate armour with a witches hat instead of a helm, instead of a staff she wields a wand and longsword. She has dark skin square face and a bald head.

The Witch of the Watching fire has the most active apprentices of any coven apart from the Witch of the Waiting Web. Currently there are 7 officially signed apprentices.

The Watching fire concern themselves with the jailing and defence of greater spirits of the pit. They have not many other concerns beyond their ever long job to stop the spirits from moving up levels of the underdark.

- Ambrose has never met any Witch of the Watching Fire as they are far too hard to get to and they seldom leave their post.

**Witch of the Wind and Stars**

Orion has been Witch of the Wind and Stars _Many years_ not as many as willow but almost.

Orion is a woman of middling height, dark skin black braided hair and an extraordinary amount of piercings in her ears and nose with flowing clothes that could be a gown.

The Wind and Stars seldom show interest in anything. They wander about the world offering their wisdom to those they wish with seemingly no clear reason. Their goals are their own and each successive witch has kept them close to heart.

- Ambrose and the party have all met Orion in Starsport at the start of their adventure.

**Witch of the Wide Blue Sea**

unlike past witches from her coven Kailani has elected to take a vow of solitude and live beneath the waves. She has been known to occasionally test young sailors that might show some affinity for her apprenticeship but none have lived to tell the tale. She has been like this for the past 500 years.

only having one predecessors the witch of the wide blue sea seemingly does not have any goals beyond finding an apprentice who can brave the waves for her.

- Ambrose has never met the Witch of the Wide Blue Sea

**Witch of the Wizened Stone**

Durga is a stone Dwarf, and the only other Current Male Witch. He has held that position for the past 40 or so years.

Living in an underground expansive library attached to a mystic forge Durga lives beneath Highkeep on the path to the underdark. He Acts as a protector of knowledge and preservation of it is his main goal.

One of the core precepts of Durgaâ€™s philosophy is that you cannot lose knowledge by bestowing it upon someone else. you actually double the knowledge.

He does not discriminate in the information he gives however.

- Ambrose is friends with Durga having met him on multiple occasions when they were both training in their respective Covens.

**Witch of the Waiting Web**

Tangleda is a tall lanky and cunning witch she has amassed nearly 20 official apprentices who all act as advisors to people in important positions around the world. She has been witch of the waiting web for nearly 70 years.

Upon taking the position of Witch of the Waiting Web you must forgo your previous name and take a new one to be called by.

- Ambrose has met Tangleda many times in his early youth.
