**Witch of the Wild Hunt**

Hecate has been the witch of the wild hunt for over 100 years.

at this point she is more beast than Witch. She holds that her domain encroaches directly on that of people of the world. She is constantly pushing for more wilderness.

She is one to be met on equal terms and is known to have been behind many disappearances within deep woods.
