**Witch of the Watching fire**

Gabija has been Witch of the Watching Fire for the past 27 years.

Often seen wearing full plate armour with a witches hat instead of a helm, instead of a staff she wields a wand and longsword. She has dark skin square face and a bald head.

The Witch of the Watching fire has the most active apprentices of any coven apart from the [[Witch of the Waiting Web]]. Currently there are 7 officially signed apprentices.

The Watching fire concern themselves with the jailing and defence of greater spirits of the pit. They have not many other concerns beyond their ever long job to stop the spirits from moving up levels of the [[underdark]].

- [[Ambrose]] has never met any Witch of the Watching Fire as they are far too hard to get to and they seldom leave their post.
