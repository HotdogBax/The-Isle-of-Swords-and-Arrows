**Witch of the Wind and Stars**

Orion has been Witch of the Wind and Stars _Many years_ not as many as willow but almost.

Orion is a woman of middling height, dark skin black braided hair and an extraordinary amount of piercings in her ears and nose with flowing clothes that could be a gown.

The Wind and Stars seldom show interest in anything. They wander about the world offering their wisdom to those they wish with seemingly no clear reason. Their goals are their own and each successive witch has kept them close to heart.

- [[Ambrose]] and the party have all met Orion in [[Starsport]] at the start of their adventure.
