**Studies of [[Rowena]], [[Witch of the Weaving Tapestry]]**

**Morning Observations:**

- Began the day with the weaving ritual; patterns emerged intuitively, indicating a strong alignment with current energies.
- Collected herbs from the eastern glade post-rain. Notable increase in spiritual presence, suggesting heightened natural Ether.

**Afternoon Research:**

- Deciphered new protective spell from the old grimoire. Enhanced wards around [[the Cave]] and castle to counteract recent negative energies.
- Significant find: spells that appeared obscure now reveal intricate details, hinting at evolving magical perception.

**Evening Council Meeting:**

- Discussed disturbances in the magical realm with Willow and the Lady of the Lake. Consensus: a shift is occurring, requiring increased vigilance.
- Key Topic: Faberson's Conundrum—a philosophical and metaphysical puzzle involving complex mathematics and the nature of magic. Both [[The Lady of the Lake]] and [[Willow]] seemed disinterested in my pursuit. I shall bring it up to [[Petra]] next time I see her.

**Faberson's Conundrum:**

- Central issue: Magic is formless before perception and takes form upon being perceived.
- Challenge: To solve the conundrum, one must perceive formless magic, a paradox that defies current understanding.

**Conclusion:**

- Today's studies emphasize the interconnectedness of all magical work. The pursuit of understanding Faberson’s Conundrum highlights the limits of our perception and the potential for expanding our magical knowledge.

**Next Steps:**

- Continue protective spell research.
- Further exploration into the nature of formless magic to approach a solution for Faberson's Conundrum.
- Discuss with [[Petra]], she likely will be very interested in the new protection spell and the conundrum
