## Session 1
Started in the castle Fendelwin, bullied the poor incompetent guard captain Peter for about an hour before setting off on your quest to find and save some captured Pexie silver workers from what you believe to be goblins who have taken them from their town Silverbrook. After getting to the town you met with a man who had been injured in the attack and Quin gave them a gold piece and told them to go to the castle. you then set off into the woods along side the river following the tracks of a cart through muddy earth.

## Session 2
You all continued the path following the captured Pexies, befriended a powerful spirit of the forest with a natural 20, murdered the goblins and captured what looks to be a pirate or mercenary. You offered him a fair trial in exchange for his cooperation. You also found a letter signed by the Children of Lanodice

## Session 3
Mayor Suesbrawn interrogation - mildly corrupt therefore will interrogate, there seems like there is some witch involved with the pirates and the Cherians that wanted the pexies and silver
Other bits and pieces here and there
Bought a bunch of magic items with the mayors funds

## Session 4
You found out there was a disgruntled spirit kidnapping children at night the Bodach. While preparing a trap to spring on the creature you all went into a purple tent with golden stars and were given a glimpse into your futures by a blind woman who could see more than most. After that you all set the trap for the Bodach by luring it with a slightly younger Olaf and his secret recipe book.

You all captured the Bodach after a slight bit of turbulence but eventually got it into a cage of iron. Everyone then spoke a truth which made the Bodach small enough to fit into a jar. 

## Session 5
You solved the riddle to get to the secret hiding place of the Bodach and the sanctuary of Rata the tree of Truth, saved the kids from an untimely death at the hands of frost, learned many things about your characters and their paths that they wish to lead, and received the letter back from King Godwin saying he needed help from someone who had been involved in warfare before.

## Session 6
You all arrived back in Fendelwin with the help of Luth making the journey significantly faster, and upon arriving you witnessed a argument in the kings court between two duke’s representatives around the creation of protective forces to halt the raids happening on their duchies. The king settled the matter saying he would make one large army to protect the whole country.

you discussed the strange alloy of silver and iron with the king and gave him council on potentially becoming allies with the giants.

From there you were each given titles as knights and diplomat and all went off to do your own tasks

Cormac and Ambrose you sought out the lady of the lake and got answers to questions and collected boons for the king

Olaf and Angar, you went to the theatre and convinced Playwright Carti to go off on an insane quest to kill a dragon at a lighthouse on the coast

after doing that you discovered strangers wandering out of the theatre with you that the guards could not see, you captured one and brought him to the king.

Chaos followed when an invisible sorcerer and assassins attacked the king nearly dropping him but you all managed to stop that from happening.

We open now on each of you getting your individual things ready to go on this trip to the Utwah Mountains to discuss an alliance or treaty with the Giants.

## Session 7
you discovered a secrete passage beneath the castle, received gifts from the king and prepared the last things you needed before the trip commences.

# Arc 1 The Journey to Hedwyr

## The Knights, the Witch and the Storyteller
You all set out on your Journey with the new Squire Rothgar. You all taught him something different on the trip towards the south.

When you arrived at Calmaria Travelers Den you met Playwright Carti performing Mystical Dragon Night Time, the first draft of his erotic novel about the prophecy that you set him on.

After collecting an image from him that very well depicts the Scarlet Witch. you all went to sleep.

## The Gnomes of Crimson and Lies P1
You met a cheating merchant on the road who you bested at rollzies with strong trickery. Then entered into Gnome town and stopped some misguided teenagers from shaking down a store. But were told where the hideout of the crimson gnomes was. You then promptly made your way there. We ended last session with 5 crossbow bolts flying down from a balcony.

## The Gnomes of Crimson and Lies P2
You fought a group of crimson gnomes and upon beating them disappeared into the night. The following day you went back to the orphanage and then set back off on your journey to Hedwyr. On the way you found a Witches tower and raided it of important information and loot.

## The siege of Hedwyr
Moving through Iron burrow, you all met two Gnomish inventors, their flame spirit Da Vinci and a squad of Knights and Squires.

Trekking through Ganothor’s Forest the party met and quickly dealt with a Giant and his underlings, after noticing the city of Hedwyr was under siege by an enormous army.

Under agreement from the duke you poisoned the army’s water, and prepared to attack at midnight.

A fire elemental set free at last, through a deal with a witch, ripped through the tents of the army’s leadership. The battle had begun.

With a company of elite knights and squires Angar and Olaf broke the back line of the enemy.

Cormac threw himself off Ambrose’s broom partially separating himself from the sword and growing to the size of a small mountain crashing through the enemy army.

The witch of the weaving Tapestry cackled, lit from below by his destruction reigning down further of the adversaries of the king.

The battle was won, can diplomacy prevail? There are few who would have the guts to attempt it.
